				<h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				The current design problem that I have identified in contemporary society is if people want to go to Freshco for grocery shopping and they do not have 25 cents, they cannot use carts. Currently, a lot of people, especially those within the young generations frequently use credit cards or phones to pay instead of bringing cash or change. The design problem inhibits people who do not have 25 cents in their pockets to use a cart. Using the basket instead would be very inconvenient because some people usually do not have enough strength to take lots of items in their baskets when they are doing grocery shopping. For the people who are from another country or who are coming to Freshco for the first time, they do not know they need to have 25 cents to borrow the cart.
			</p>

				<h3 class="title">Solutions</h3>
				
				
				<p class="p1">
					The design I made to remedy the exclusionary features in the design problem is to put a QR code close to the place where they insert 25 cents so that people can easily either use their phones to scan the code or by using 25 cents to borrow the cart. If people choose to scan the code, they should pay 25 cents as the deposit. After they return back the cart, these 25 cents would automatically return back. If people didn’t return their carts, next time they are not allowed to borrow the cart again.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                    For people who are from different cultures and who have come to Canada, they have high possibilities that don’t have changes in their pockets. The QR code could help them to use phones to borrow the cart. For the people who don’t use phones, we still provide that 25 cents option. The social and psychological barriers that
                    my design mitigate is to help everyone feel welcome to go to FreshCo and buy a lot of items they want. They would not feel rejected using carts to go shopping.
                </p>

				<h3 class="title">Challenges</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				Reflecting critically on how my design carters to diversity, the social group that my design might unwillingly exclude is people whose phones are out of charge and no coins in their pockets. They buy items by using their credit cards. They either can’t insert 25 cents nor use the phone to scan.
            </p>
            <p class="p1">
                The potential challenges that could impede the implementation of my design would be FreshCo might need more carts to make sure that more customers might use carts than before.
            </p>
            <div>
				<h3 class="title">Implement</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				I would implement my design first in the Brantford FreshCo because it’s close to my place so that I can easily get users’ feedback and make some improvements.
