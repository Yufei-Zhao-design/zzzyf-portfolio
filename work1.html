					<p class="p1">
					Harmony Square is the main square in downtown Brantford. The square comes alive with every community events and event attendance has grown annually. The problem for the Harmony Square is it doesn't have washroom and in winter, the square doesn't have place to put snow. So, our design goal is: <strong><i>How might we improve the experience of Harmony Square users during typical days and event days?</i></strong>

					<p class="p1">
						We have two people work on this project. My partner is mainly focused on typical days of the Harmony Square and I am mainly responsible for event days. I go to the Harmony Square on Homecoming day, observe and sketch what pepole did and notice what problems they face while they are at the Harmony Square. I also interviewed two users and asked them what improvements they are expected to see in the future about the Harmony Square. Based on these data I collected, I made the experience map and persona. I find out two solutions to satisfy users' needs and solve the problems.

						<strong>
							Washroom
						</strong>
						</h4>
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						During the naturalistic observation, it was found that people use the space that we plan to put washroom as a pathway. So we thought we would leave space for people to walk through. As space is limited these would be single-stall washrooms.
					</p>
					<h4 class="subtitle">
						<strong>
							Snow Removal
						</strong>
					</h4>
					<p class="p1">
						To resolve the problem of having no place to put excess snow, we decided to create a snow mountain in the middle entrance on Dalhousie St. During the observation we found only one person out of twenty-five, used that entrance as a pathway. Three people walk to that area but only to sit on the benches. As this area is not commonly used as a pathway, we decided to put the snow mountain there. Events like snowman building can also be done there and it could become a sculpture for the pedestrians to view. This could be a destresser for pedestrians during their busy days. Moreover, it could also help the community feel more welcoming.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						We also decided to move two of the benches to the other side so that people could continue to use the benches without the snow mountain being in the way.
					</p>
					<p class="p1">
						In the summertime, this would continue to be a pathway and the plants and flowers can act as decorations instead of the snow mountain.
