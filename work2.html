                        In Canada, there are many disabled people, and it is not convenient for them to go to the national parks because lots of facilities and places are not fully accessible . As the data shown from the Statistics Canada, there are about 6.2 million disabled people in Canada in 2017. In England, designers have already designed the Changing Places Washroom for disabled people, and this design project goal is: 
                        <strong><i>How might we improve the Changing Places washrooms become fully accessible?</i></strong>

                            <strong>Strength</strong> for the Changing Places washrooms:<br> 
                            The tools inside are really helpful for the disabled people. Only the people who have proved they are disabled can get the Radar key and have the authority to use the washroom (Changing-Places.org). This can prevent some people who have no disabilities using the Changing Places washrooms. Also, the Radar key can prevent some people entering the Changing Places washrooms to damage the expensive tools inside the washroom. What's more, now we have mobile Changing Places washrooms. This is really useful when national parks have some special activities.<br>

                                <li class="list">The amounts of the Changing Places washrooms are not enough because the Changing Places washrooms need large space, lots of funding and a lot of people have no awareness about how difficult it is for disabled people going to the public parks that lack accessible facilities.</li>
                                <li class="list">The Changing Places washrooms do not have obvious signs. It’s inconvenient for people to find the Changing Places washroom fast.</li>

                            <strong>Opportunities</strong> for the Changing Places washrooms:<br>
                            It’s the opportunity to let able-bodied people know about the disabled people, and think about what they can do to make the lives of people who are disabled more accessible than before.

                            The facilities in the Changing Places washrooms are expensive and  requires a large amount of funding.

                                I interviewed some disabled families and ask them about their views on the accessible washroom. I also did lots of research about disabled people and watched the documentary "When Bill Broke His Head...And Other Tales of Wonder". Based on the data I gathered, I made the empathy map and two personas which includes users' pains and gains.

                        Recommendations
                    </h3>
                    <p class="p1">
                        To increase the accessibility of the Changing Places washrooms, the Changing Places washrooms should be set near the places that disabled people go very often, however, washrooms will still be built around the whole park. Changing Places washrooms are also needed near parking lots than other areas because some of the disabled families have a long way from home to the National Park, they might need to go to the Changing Places washroom after they get off the car. The signs of the Changing Places washrooms should be large enough for people to see, and placed beside the Changing Places washroom. The Changing Places washrooms should also have accessible trails that ensure easy access for wheelchair users.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        To make sure the people who are searching for a Changing Places washroom know which Changing Places washroom already has people inside, it should have a noticeable light outside the door. When someone is already inside, the light would turn on, and other disabled people can see clearly from a far distance so that they can decide whether to find another Changing Places washroom or just come and wait for this Changing Places washroom.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        The cleaness of the Changing Places washrooms are very important. The cleaning staff should go to the Changing Places washroom after every two hours. They need to keep the washroom clean and make sure all the tools work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        Inside the washrooms, they could add a voice reminder and posting the reminder information on the back of the door i.e in poster form - ‘Don’t forget to charge tools and return all tools back before you leave.’ When people open the door and leave without charging tools, they would hear a voice reminder and see the notice on the back of the door so that they can remember to charge the tools.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        The most important part is to make able-bodied people know how to care for the disabled people. Lots of able-bodied people don’t have the awareness about the accessible needs of the disabled. So the first thing that needs to be done is to raise awareness about accessibility for people with disabilities. A way of dealing with this issue is introducing the topic of disability in the school curriculum in order to educate students on the issues that disabled people face. Also, schools can invite disabled families to tell their stories and explain their problems.This can help students grow to be empathetic since they are young. For the high school and university students, they could have some assignments that let them do some research about disabilities. Also, the community could organize some events on disability awareness. Actions like raising money for the community could help in funding accessible facilities; inviting disabled families to share their stories and even letting able-bodied people spend a few hours sitting in a wheelchair to experience a glimpse of disabled people’s lives. These can all be done to raise their awareness about accessibility for people with disabilities.
