				<h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				For the SDP2 project, our group designed a smart cigarette case. The case can use Bluetooth to connect with the phone application. Users could set the number of cigarettes that can be smoked per day on their phone. If the number of cigarettes taken out by the smoker reaches the upper limit, the cigarette case would be locked for the rest of that day. The case can be disassembled into two parts: the cigarette container part and the cigarette butts storage part. When users finish smoking, they can throw their cigarette butts in the storage part instead of throwing them on the street. The cigarette butts storage part can be easily taken out to clean.

                <p class="p1">
                    Based on our research, in 2019, there are 3.7 million smokers in Canada. Smoking is harmful not only to the smoker but also to family members and friends because of the inhalation of second-hand smoke. Also, cigarette butts contain chemicals that contaminate our waterways, ground soil and harm our wildlife. Therefore, our group decided to design a smart cigarette case that can help smokers control and reduce their daily cigarette usage. On the surface of our cigarette case, it has a slide lock with indicator light. When the cigarette case is in the low battery mode, the light would keep on shinning. This can visually help users to know they need to charge the case. Also, when users take out the last cigarette for that day, the case would vibrate and remind users.

                    For this project, our group uses the design thinking process to design our cigarette case. In the discovery phase, our group first did some research about smoking. We found out nowadays there are so many smokers, especially the pandemic makes people easy to get stressed and starts to smoke. Based on these basic researches, we defined our problem statement: How might we design a product that helps smokers quit smoking, get families involved, build a better community image and protect the environment?
                </p>
                <p class='p1'>
                    Then we moved to the ideation phase. We started brainstorming what functions can this cigarette case have and how to connect our product to the IoT(Internet of Things)? We decided to use Bluetooth to connect our cigarette case with the phone application. The cigarette case should include a part to store cigarette butts. 
                </p>
                <p class='p1'>
                    After the ideation phase, we start to prototype our ideas. We first sketch out our ideas and we decided to add a screen on the surface of the cigarette case. The screen can remind smokers how many cigarettes they left for that day and also show the battery life. To prevent the cigarette butts storage part separate from the case accidentally, we decided to add a slide locker. When the lock slides to the middle, users can open the storage part and put their cigarette butts inside. When the lock slides to the right, users can separate the storage part with the cigarette case. This can make users easy to clean the cigarette butts storage part. We also consider some somatic design in our product such as vibration and visual light. Finally, we made our presentation in front of the class and got some useful feedback from the class.

				<p class="p1">
                    The project helps me to start thinking about incorporating the Internet of Things into the design. When we present our idea to the whole class, I think our peers are interested in our thoughts of having an indicator light to remind users to charge the case visually. Based on the feedback from the class, someone suggests we add a place to put nicotine gum in our design. Nicotine gum can help smokers to alleviate the desire to smoke. To add a place to store the gum is a great point, and I believe we would consider this part in our future design.
