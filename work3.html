                    One Market is a building that located in downtown Brantford. It used to be the shopping mall and Wilfrid Laurier University purchased this building from the city of Brantford in 2014. So, for this project we are redesigning the first floor of One Market, designing a creative co-working space in One Market and ensure the safety in the building. The two main problems that our group focused on solving are: lack of opportunities in the community; disconnection between Brantford locals, Indigenous people, and the Laurier community.

                    Our team has 4 members and during the Ideation Phase, all group members brainstormed ideas addressing every important sector for this assignment. I do the research about the One Market. I also interviewed 2 Laurier students, 1 Conestoga student and 2 Brantford workers.

                        After the interview it was found that 70 percent of people agree to the idea of the Mini Market and Cafeteria. With this in mind we realised that we were on the right track however could make further improvements. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        We would add some study rooms. Students did not want to study where there was food and were worried that the whiteboard tables would get dirty. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        After talking to the indigenous people, instead of having Farmer's Market, we thought giving them a vendor space where indigenous people could sign up to sell the item on a different day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        The security guard recommended us that Mini Market with Cafeteria should only have one entrance and exit so that it could reduce possibilities of stealing.
