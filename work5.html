				<h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				Nowadays, lots of parents would take their kids to travel and airplane would be one of the best choices for travelling. But during the long journey, kids are easy to lose patience for. The people around are all strangers and the environment is unfamiliar, the kids would have anxiety on the plane and sometimes they might cry and disrupt other passengers. At this time, parents would bring their kids to the washroom to wipe away kids’ tears and prevent their kids’ crying. The narrow spaces of the washroom would be difficult for parents to make their children calm down. Also, the height of the toilet is too tall for children to use by themslelves. This design problem inhibits inclusion of kids using washrooms by themselves on the plane.
			</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3 class="title">Solutions</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>To make the height of the hand sink table and the toilet adjustable.</li>
					<li>To add some kid's wall arts in the washroom.</li>
					<li>To put a toy machine outside the washroom door, and parents can buy the toys for their kids.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p class="p1">
					Because of the space on the plane is limited, so I would enlarge the space, I’m not putting additional stuff to take up the limited space. The social and psychological barriers that my design mitigate is to relieve children’s depressed emotions when they are in a limited space, by using toys to distract their unhappy mood. Moreover, kids would not cry for a long time and disturb other passengers taking rest.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3 class="title">Challenges</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				Reflecting critically on the inclusivity of my design, the social group that my design might unwittingly exclude is the children who have visual impairment. They can’t see the colorful wall arts. 
			</p>
			<p class="p1">
				The potential challenge that could impede the implementation of my design is some kids might spend lots of time staying close to the
				washroom because of the toy machine. This would make other passengers wait for a long time to use the washroom. Also, when sometimes all the
				passengers need to fasten seat belts, children might refuse to go back to the
				seat.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="title">Implement</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				I’m planning to implement my design first in the international flights because the long flight would easily cause children’s unhappy mood and the first implement would help me know whether it’s useful or not.
