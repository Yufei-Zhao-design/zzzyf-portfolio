				<h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				Nowadays, translators are always some applications on the phone or pocket devices. A lot of translation devices only focused on the most popular and widely spoken languages in the world, which prevent diversity. These translation devices and applications also inhibit people who lose their arms to use because people need to use hands to hold devices and press buttons. For pocket translation devices, they excluded people who can’t speak to use these devices because users need to press the button and hold it until users finish their speech. People who can’t speak would feel they are not welcomed by using these devices because they cannot express their ideas. Also, pocket translation devices excluded people who can’t hear because the machine would recognize what people said and then speak out the translation result. People who can’t hear would be disappointed and feel they are rejected to use this translator because they can’t hear the translation result. Translating applications on the phone inhibit people who do not have smartphones to use these applications.

                <h3 class="title">Solutions</h3>
                
				<ul>
					<li>The translation earphone offers a broad translation for all official languages.</li>
					<li>For people who cannot hear the sound, we add a unique vibrate function </li>
					<li>The translation earphone can choose to use Bluetooth to connect with the application on the phone or to use the earphone as a separate translator.</li>
                </ul>

				<h3 class="title">Challenges</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				Reflecting critically on my synthesized design, the social group that my design might unwittingly exclude is people who lose both hands and can’t talk at the same time. For people who have lost their hands and cannot speak at the same time, they can neither activate their earphones by voice nor type what they want to say in the application.
 
			</p>
			<p class="p1">
				The potential challenge that could impede the implementation of my design is for people who are learning a language they may rely too much on this earphone, which will make their learning progress slow.

				<h3 class="title">Implement</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				I would implement my design first in the Laurier community because Laurier has diverse students from different cultures. As a member of the Laurier community, I can get the feedback quickly and make some improvements.
