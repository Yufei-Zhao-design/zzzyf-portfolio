                <h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
            <p class="p1">
                Humanities include Modern languages, Literature, Philosophy, History, Human Geography, Law, Politics, Religion and Art. Many people feel humanities are bland and boring. Most people even don't exactly know what are the humanities. Our team has 7 members, we do this design project to make Laurier Humanities Program Website looks attractive and appealing new students to study Humanities Program.

                <h4 class="subtitle">
                    <strong>
                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                </h4>
                <h4 class="subtitle">
                    <strong>
                        Ideation
                    </strong>
                </h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    During the Ideation phase, our group members brainstorm and generate ideas together. We found current content in the space is disinteresting. So we are thinking of making attractive videos and assignments for content. We decide to make two types of videos:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Content Videos</strong>: Content videos will be made by current students as assignments and will display the type of interesting content learned by current students.</li>
                        <li><strong>Informative Videos</strong>: Introducing potential students to the humanities and leadership program. Use stats and research to support claims within videos.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4 class="subtitle">
                    <strong>
                        Prototyping
                    </strong>
                </h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    We first began with an initial hand drawn prototype in a sketchbook. Next, transformed into a digital version. Lastly, created multiple pages to reach a finished product.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subtitle">
                    <strong>
                        Testing
                    </strong>
                </h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    We tested our prototyping to Laurier freshmen and Grade 12 students. We got the minor feedback (words, pictures,links) and the major feedback (seperate pages for videos).
                </p>
                <h4 class="subtitle">
                    <strong>
                        Iterations
                    </strong>
                </h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    With the feedback we received and the research we did, we realized that we needed to update the current humanities website with a brand new page to act as a hub for the videos. We then created two separate pages for the videos that we want to display. This first page contains videos focusing on introducing the user to the humanities. The second page, called the “Student’s Theatre”, is where we will showcase the student’s creative course work. From video projects to audio podcasts, this page will serve as a spotlight page for some of the best work that students have done in their courses in the humanities and leadership program.

                <p class="p1">
                    Our final product is a culmination of all of these steps through constant iteration. The website is updated and used as a vehicle for us to gain the interest of the users to the humanities and leadership program. The videos will help our users gain a better understanding of what the humanities are, where their future is and how they can benefit from the skills they will learn in this program.
            </div>

                <h3 class="title">The Action Plan</h3>
                <p class="p1">
                    Our goal towards making our action plan a reality was to build critical partnerships and relationships with the current students and professors in the humanities and leadership program. It will be a partnership with the students and faculty to make sure that the mental and physical well being of students remains as important with potential curriculum changes.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                    We hope it will show the students that the partnership we will gain with Laurier can assure them that everything that our team has come up with is beneficial to the future of the humanities and leadership program. On the topic of building trust, we need to build enough confidence with our potential investors. We will also build trust by staying in constant communication with our investors and making sure we keep the USERS at the forefront of any innovations.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                    The timeline for this entire process was one of the more difficult things to unwind. We believe the changes to the website will happen over a number of years.
