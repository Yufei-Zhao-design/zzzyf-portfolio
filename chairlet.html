				<h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				Our group designed a product called “Chairlet”, which is a Bluetooth-connected computer chair. It is an automatically height-adjustable chair. When users sitting on this chair for a long time, they will still feel comfortable. We added a touchpad on the armrest part so that users could easily control the mouse when they are using the computer. We also decided to add the speaker on the headrest part of the chair, and some vibrating motors on the back of the chair. These can help users have a more immersive experience compared to the other chairs. The vibrating function also helps people who cannot hear feel the sound from the computer.

				<p class="p1">
                    Our design includes 2 parts: sensor-based device (for children), and digital app (for parents).

                    Based on my personal experience, I feel the current chair I have is not comfortable enough to sit for a long time. When I’m sitting on a chair, I don’t know whether my position is correct or not. Therefore, our group decided to innovate the chair, which would be a user-friendly and inclusive experience for users to feel comfortable sitting. We are thinking to put touchpads on both sides of the armrests. This can help both left-handed users and right-handed users. For some people whose arm get injured, they can also use this chair. The speaker and vibration part can also help people with hearing and visual impairments to use.

				<p class="p1">
                    Since we need to use chairs every day, our group decided to design a multifunctional chair that can be comfortable for everyone to sit on. At the beginning of the design, I closed my eyes, feel how every part of my body touched the chair and wrote down my feelings. Then our group had an online meeting and generated our ideas together. Based on our ideas and the feedback from our classmates. We then decided to create a chair with automatic height adjustment because most of the people mentioned they don’t know whether their sitting positions are correct or not. Then we start brainstorming what other functions can be added to our design. We came up with the idea of somatic design and touchpad idea.

                <p class='p1'>
                    After the ideation phase, we sketch out our ideas. Then I started to use Tinkercad to create the 3D prototype. When I was making the prototype, I was thinking about how to prevent users from accidentally swiping the touchpad. Therefore, our group added the fingerprint function on the touchpad. Only when users put the finger on that button for 3 seconds can they start to use the touchpad on the chair. Finally, we present our project to the class and get some useful feedback.

                    This project helps me know how to incorporate somatic design in our project. When we are designing the product, we could ground understanding of tactile stimuli in our own somatic, felt experience first. Also, based on the feedback from the class,  I think our group should consider the charge outlet part. Now we put the charging cable at the bottom of the seat. Users need to plug in and charge the seat while they are using the chair. Using the charger with a cord is very inconvenient, especially if the chair started to use in the classroom. Therefore, I think in the future, we need to consider how to let the chair charge wirelessly. We also need to test our prototype with more users and get more feedback to improve our product.
