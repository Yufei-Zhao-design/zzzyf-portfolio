				<h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
			<p class="p1">
				Nowadays, more and more people start to shop online, especially in the Covid-19 situation. As I live in the apartment, when I shop online, I feel so tired that I need to take the bus to the delivery station and get the package by myself. The apartment I stay has three floors, and it doesn’t have the elevators. I live on the third floor, so every time I need to hold the paper box to climb the stairs. Based on my experience, I found the express box is not inclusive, and it’s difficult for users to carry. Also, if I buy many things online, I would get many express boxes. These boxes take up a lot of space and cannot be recycled. Therefore, our group decided to hack a recyclable and collapsible express box and make it more functional and accessible than the traditional box.

				<p class="p1">
                    Materials we used for the recyclable and collapsible express box are normal cardboards, scissor, luggage straps and wheels. We are thinking of using the luggage straps as the handle and insert four wheels at the bottom of the box. The handle and wheels can help users carry and move the box easily. We would make four cuts on the edges of the bottom side of the box and use two luggage straps to pass through these four cuts. These two luggage straps would finally intersect at the top of the box and it would be the handle of the box. If users want to save space at home, they could take out the straps, and fold the box. Users could also use this express box as the storage box. If they want to put the box in a fixed position, they can just hide the wheels inside the box, and the bottom of the box would be flat.

                    Due to the pandemic, our group make an online conference together. We first brainstormed by ourselves, and then generate ideas together. After discussion, our group decided to design a recyclable and collapsible express box. As it’s a recyclable and environmentally friendly product, we shouldn’t use tape, instead, we need to find a new way to close the box. During the ideation process, we did the research and discussion, and then we sketched out the basic prototype. Considering the function and accessibility, we listed some ideas, such as add a handle, insert wheels, etc. Based on these discussion results, we created the prototype. Due to the Covid-19, our group members can’t meet together and make a physical prototype, so we created a digital prototype. We found the difficult part is the ideas for our digital prototype are good but it might not work if we make the physical prototype. Therefore, we tested the prototype to our friends and got the feedback. In the iteration process, we make some improvements, for example, instead of using luggage straps to fix the box, we decide to cut edges for connection. These edges for connection help users easily fix or assemble the box during the secondary assembly.

                    This project is my first time having a group maker project remotely. From this design project, I learned how to conduct online group meetings efficiently and allocate the tasks of each group member reasonably. I also read some articles about making and designing. By hacking the box this time, I have the chance to use the theoretical knowledge in the book into practice, and now I have a more comprehensive understanding of making than before. Though this time we don’t have a chance to make a real product in the maker lab, it’s still a good experience to have this maker project.
